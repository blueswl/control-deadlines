## Adding/updating a conference

To add or update information:
- Fork the repository
- Update `_data/conferences.yml`
- Make sure it has the `title`, `fullname`, `year`, `id`, `link`, `deadline`, `timezone`, `date`, `place`, `sub` attributes
    + See available timezone strings [here](https://momentjs.com/timezone/)
    + Multiple `sub` attributes can be separated by commas (see [`_data/types.yml`](https://github.com/sisl/sisl-deadlines/blob/gh-pages/_data/types.yml))

- Optionally:
	+ Add an `abstract_deadline` in case the conference has a separate mandatory abstract deadline
	+ Add a `rank` based on the H-Index _ordering_ from [Computer Science Conferences Rankings][14]
	+ Add a `note` for additional comments (e.g., "Biennial" or "Doctorial consortium")
- Run `update.bat` which sorts conferences by deadline, verifies the YML file, and updates the .ics calendar file
- Send a pull request
